## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Requires a Twilio "Try WhatsApp" Sandbox is set up under your Twilio account (can be uograded later to a paid Twilio number)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twilio-autorag-bot.git
cd twilio-autorag-bot
```

### 2. Install Wrangler CLI (if not installed)

```bash
npm i -g wrangler
```

### 3. Add your secrets

```bash
wrangler secret put CF_API_TOKEN
wrangler secret put CF_ACCOUNT_ID
wrangler secret put AUTORAG_SLUG
wrangler secret put TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
wrangler secret put TWILIO_AUTH_TOKE
wrangler secret put TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### 5. Set up Twilio
After deploying the Cloudflare Worker, copy the deployed Worker URL (e.g., https://twilio-autorag-bot.yourdomain.workers.dev) and paste it into the "WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN" field under:

1. Twilio Console ‚Üí Messaging ‚Üí Sandbox for WhatsApp ‚Üí Sandbox Configuration
2. Scroll to the "Sandbox Configuration" section.
3. Paste your deployed URL into the "When a message comes in" field.
4. Ensure this field Method is set to "POST"
